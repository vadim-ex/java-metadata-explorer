# Java Metadata Explorer

This is a simple way to generate Java metadata diagrams using Graphwiz Dot.

The diagrams contain a lot of conventions. They need better documentation.
They are good as a starting point although.

Some ways of using the code is implicitly documented in `./t` bash script.
Consider running:

```bash
./t --help
```

In near plans:

* add golden master tests (which work as demos too);
* input parameters to select jar / class;
